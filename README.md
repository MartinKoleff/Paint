# Paint
his is my Course Project - Paint in C# in collaboration with my colleague - Spas Milenkov!

The project had to include:
- Original idea!
- 3 Form Windows
- All 4 Pillars of OOP (Abstraction, Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Inheritance)
- LINQ
- Serialization

What the project actually includes:
- All of the criterias above!
- 4 different Shapes (Rectangle, Square, Triangle, Circle)
- All shapes have editor forms where you can change their size and color. The triangle has additional special editor where you can make custom triangle with 3 points selected by the user!
- All shapes have logic for if a point is inside them
- All shapes can be moved when selected!
- Selection rectangle which selects all shapes inside it
- Brush
- Eraser
- Delete button for all selected shapes
- Reset canvas button
